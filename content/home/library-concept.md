A LibrePCB library is more than just a collection of stupid graphics for
symbols and footprints -- they are
[organized in a meaningful, semantic manner]({{< relref "features/library-concept/index.adoc" >}}).
This makes library management more fun and eliminates many problems known
from other EDA tools.
