The [*Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting (FOSDEM)*](https://fosdem.org/)
is a great event for developers and users interested in free software. It is
hosted at the ULB Solbosch Campus in Brussels, Belgium. This year it takes
place on **February 3 / 4**.

There are many different tracks available, but for us the most interesting one
is the [**CAD and Open Hardware devroom**](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/track/cad_and_open_hardware/).
It contains talks about PCB design, FPGA design, SPICE simulation and open
hardware in general.

And this year we have submitted the [**Introduction to LibrePCB**](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/cad_librepcb/)
talk to present our project! The talk takes place on **Saturday, February 3,
16:00 in room K.4.201**. For those who cannot attend, there are also
[live streams](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/streaming/) available :-)
