I am very happy to announce that the LibrePCB project receives support
from the https://nlnet.nl/entrust/[NGI0 Entrust] Fund, a fund established
by https://nlnet.nl[NLnet] with financial support from the European
Commission's https://ngi.eu[Next Generation Internet] programme.

This helps us to ensure the development of important features planned for the
upcoming releases. Especially the next major release will extend LibrePCB with
many new capabilities. Some of them have already been implemented, but there
is still a lot of work to be done. I'll write a blog post about the status
and goals of the next release soon.

Stay tuned!
