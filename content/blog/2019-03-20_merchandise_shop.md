You like LibrePCB and need some new clothes or a coffee mug? Then you might be
interested in the [merchandise shop](https://shop.spreadshirt.com/librepcb/)
which got online today!

### The Initial Idea

Actually I just wanted to order some LibrePCB T-shirts for myself and thus was
looking for a shop which allows to print custom designs on T-shirts. Then I
found [spreadshop](https://www.spreadshop.com/) which even allows to create
whole *shops* with custom designs, so other people can order the same products
too!

I liked that idea as it allows everyone to easily order some LibrePCB T-shirts,
hoodies or other products too. And even better, LibrePCB receives a commission
on every order made in that shop, so we get an additional way to contribute to
the LibrePCB project.

For details about the concept, take a look at
[spreadshop](https://www.spreadshop.com/), the provider of this service.

### 15% off for 14 days

Finally I decided that's worth a try and thus opened the shop today. You will
get 15% off the first 14 days, so let's order quickly :-)

Thanks for everyone contributing to LibrePCB, either via the new merchandise
shop or any other method!
