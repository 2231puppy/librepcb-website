title: LibrePCB 1.0 Roadmap
author: U. Bruhin
---

As mentioned in the
link:{{< relref "blog/2023-04-13_ngi0_grant/index.adoc" >}}[previous blog post],
I'll give you a short update about the status of the upcoming release which
is currently in development.

Time for 1.0!
-------------

The original plan was that the next release after LibrePCB 0.1.7 will have
the version number 0.2. But thanks to the
link:{{< relref "blog/2023-04-13_ngi0_grant/index.adoc" >}}[NGI0 grant] I'm
now able to spend much more time for LibrePCB, allowing to include more
features in the next release than initially planned.

While the lack of important features in version 0.1 â€“ like slotted pads or
thermal reliefs â€“ still represent a show-stopper for LibrePCB in various
projects, I'm convinced that the features now planned for the next release
will make LibrePCB usable for much more PCB projects out there. I think this
big step should be represented by the version number so it will be bumped
to 1.0.

File Format
-----------

As the major version bump indicates, the next release introduces a new file
format revision for libraries and projects since various extensions are
needed for the new features. But no worries, the libraries and projects
created with LibrePCB 0.1.x will automatically and smoothly be upgraded to
the new file format. More information on this topic will be provided in the
release notes.

Implemented Features
--------------------

Beside
https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A1.0.0[many small improvements],
the following major features have been implemented within the last few months
and will be contained in the next release for sure:

- Thermal relief pads in planes
  (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1160[#1160])
- Plated and non-plated slots
  (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1071[#1071],
  https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1076[#1076])
- Rounded and custom footprint pad shapes
  (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1102[#1102],
  https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1103[#1103])
- Configurable automatic stop mask and solder paste on pads
  (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1137[#1137])
- Fiducials and other pad types
  (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1142[#1142],
  https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1143[#1143])
- Automatic, minimal THT pad annular rings
  (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1097[#1097])
- Locking placement of board items
  (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1144[#1144])
- Adding text labels & polygons to schematics
  (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/806[#806],
  https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/810[#810])
- Movable name/value labels in schematics
  (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1085[#1085])
- Custom placement of symbol pin text label
  (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/971[#971])
- Optionally show pin numbers in schematics
  (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1149[#1149])
- IPC D-356A netlist export
  (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1081[#1081])
- Fully configurable colors
  (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1086[#1086])

Highlight: 3D Viewer & STEP Export (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1156[#1156])
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At least visually, the coolest new feature is the 3D board viewer!
{{< icon "fa-solid fa-rocket" >}} Packages can be extended with STEP models
which will be visualized in the 3D viewer. In addition, the whole board can
be exported as a STEP model for importing the PCB into a mechanical 3D CAD.

Planned Features
----------------

There are still https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/milestone/2[many issues]
planned to be resolved in the next release, including the following major
features:

- Keepout zones
- Blind/buried vias
- MPN management & assembly variants
- Unified production data files generator

At least that's the plan for now, but as always plans might be adjusted if
priorities change or unexpected issues occur ðŸ˜‰

Due to the large amount of work still to be done, it's hard to estimate
when the release will be ready. Probably you shouldn't expect it before
August this year. I hope you are as much excited about it as I am ðŸ˜€

Anything Missing?
-----------------

Do you think there is something very important missing from the list of
planned features? Please link:{{< relref "/help/help/index.adoc" >}}[let us know]!
However, note that complex features like hierarchical sheets or schematic buses
are not planned yet by intention since these would heavily delay the next
release.
