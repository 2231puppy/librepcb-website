We are happy to announce a new partnership with
[PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com), a large and popular PCB manufacturer from
China!

### About PCBWay

As a PCB designer you might already know [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com)
since it's a very popular PCB manufacturer -- for both, hobbyists and
professionals. They offer a lot of capabilities (e.g. materials, colors,
surface finish, panelization, assembly, ...) for a competitive price.

For details, please check out their
[capabilities sheet](https://www.pcbway.com/capabilities.html).

### LibrePCB Fab Integration

The first part of the partnership is the integration into our PCB ordering
service [LibrePCB Fab](https://fab.librepcb.org). From now on, users can
choose between PCBWay and our existing partner [AISLER](https://aisler.net):

This makes LibrePCB Fab a complete solution for all needs -- AISLER is the
perfect choice for less experienced users (thanks to the simple, guided order
process and the
[rendering guarantee](https://aisler.community/t/the-rendering-guarantee/55))
and for European LibrePCB users in general, while PCBWay covers all the needs
of more complex designs (>4 layers, custom colors, special surface finish, ...)
or Asian LibrePCB users in general (of course both manufacturers offer
world-wide shipping, but usually a more local manufacturer still leads to
lower shipping costs and faster delivery).

### Sponsorship

In addition to the LibrePCB Fab integration, PCBWay is also sponsoring the
LibrePCB project with a donation! {{< icon "icon-rocket" >}}

And with every order made through LibrePCB Fab, LibrePCB receives an additional
donation from PCBWay. So, no matter which manufacturer you choose, ordering
PCBs through LibrePCB Fab stays the easiest way to help us keeping the
development of LibrePCB ongoing!

Many thanks to PCBWay for this support!

### What's next?

Although LibrePCB Fab is very useful already, there's still room for
improvements. The next step will be to support using the manufacturer's
assembly service in addition to the PCB manufacturing service. We'll keep
you updated about the progress on this topic.
