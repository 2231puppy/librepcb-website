**Here it is: The long awaited blog of LibrePCB!**

![Hello Blog!](/img/hello_blog.png)

It's still very basic, but this will be improved some time ;)

From now on, we will use this blog to provide various information, e.g. 
announcements of upcoming events, release notes, development progress or
technical explanations.

If you have any input regarding this blog or our website in general, please open
an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LibrePCB/librepcb-website).
