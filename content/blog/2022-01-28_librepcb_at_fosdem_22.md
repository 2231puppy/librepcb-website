After the
[introduction to LibrePCB talk at FOSDEM 18](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/cad_librepcb/)
and the
[status update talk at FOSDEM 20](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/librepcb/),
I'm happy to give one more update about the current project status at FOSDEM 22!

The status update talk will take place on **Saturday, February 5, at 12:00
CET**. Due to obvious reasons, it's an online event this year. After the talk
we will have some time for a live Q&A session. The details, including the links
to join the livestream or the chat, are available
[here](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/librepcb/).

I'm looking forward to meet you online at FOSDEM 22!
