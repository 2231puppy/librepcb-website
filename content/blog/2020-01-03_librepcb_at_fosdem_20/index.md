title: LibrePCB Talk at FOSDEM 2020

It's two years ago since I gave the
[introduction to LibrePCB](https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/cad_librepcb/)
talk at FOSDEM 18. This was a milestone in the history of LibrePCB since it was
the first time LibrePCB was actively presented to a large audience.

Since that talk, there was a huge progress regarding LibrePCB. Therefore I
decided to submit a
[status update talk](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/librepcb/) at
FOSDEM 2020. The talk takes place on **Saturday, February 1,
10:55 in room H.2213 at the ULB Solbosch Campus in Brussels, Belgium**.
As always, there are also
[live streams](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/streaming/) available.

See you in Brussels! :-)
