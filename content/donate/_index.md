LibrePCB is an open source project – it's made by the community, for the
community. This means that everyone can use LibrePCB without paying for it.

But if you like LibrePCB, please consider supporting the ongoing development of
LibrePCB with a donation. The more donations are made, the more time we can put
into the development of new features to make LibrePCB even more powerful.


### Ordering PCBs at AISLER

You want to order a PCB designed with LibrePCB? In that case you can support
LibrePCB by ordering your PCBs at
[AISLER](https://aisler.net/partners/librepcb)! No separate payment for the
donation is needed – just export your LibrePCB project to a `*.lppz` file (in
the "File" menu of the schematic- or board editor), upload it to
[aisler.net](https://aisler.net/partners/librepcb) and order PCBs as usual.
AISLER will then automatically make a donation to LibrePCB.


### Patreon
