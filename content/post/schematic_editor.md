The schematic editor is very easy to use and still powerful. Thanks to the
innovative library concept, you don't have to worry about choosing footprints
while drawing the schematic. In contrast to other EDA tools, you also don't have
to worry about manually assigning symbol pins to footprint pads later in the
board editor.
